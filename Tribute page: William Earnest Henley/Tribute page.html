        William Ernest Henley was an English poet, critic and editor of the late victoria era. 
        <br><br> From the age of 12, Henley suffered from Tuberculosis, a disease which resulted in the amputation of one of his legs. While in hospital, Henley wrote many 'hospital poems', which have since become famous.
        <br><br> His most famous 'hospital poem' is 'Invictus', written in 1875. The poem explains that as humans, we experience pain, sufferring and challanges throughout our lives. However, we can strive to overcome these challanges and accept our fates, no matter the hurdle. 
        <br><br> The ideas laid out within 'Invictus' strongly reflect elements of stoic philosophy, and the victorian drive to keep a 'stiff upper lip'. The poem has now gone on to inspire millions around the world.

        Black as the pit from pole to pole,<br>
        I thank whatever gods may be<br>

        In the fell clutch of circumstance<br>

        Under the bludgeonings of chance<br>
        My head is bloody, but unbowed.<br>
        <br>
        Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br>
        Looms but the Horror of the shade,<br>
        And yet the menace of the years<br>
        Finds and shall find me unafraid.<br>
        <br> 
        It matters not how strait the gate,<br>
        How charged with punishments the scroll,<br>
        I am the master of my fate,<br>
        I am the captain of my soul.

          In glory and in glee.<br>
